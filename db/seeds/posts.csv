Game Section Updated!,"June 20th, 2019","Hello everyone! It's been awhile since I last updated, so I have decided to fix that mistake by sprucing the place up a little. I have cleaned up the visual presentation a bit and updated the About and Games sections.

Feel free to poke around and check out what's new! If you've already seen all there is to see in the current Games section, know that while I don't have any personal projects nearing completion right now, I've always got a few things brewing, so check back again in a few months and maybe that will have changed. You never know when inspiration will strike!"
Game Section Updated!,"October 6th, 2016","Hello again everyone! I have been teaching myself Ruby lately, and I've updated the games section to include the small text-adventure game I made using the Ruby language. You can compete with friends to see who can get the highest score. Or just compete with yourself, if you have no friends.

In case anyone missed it, I also took the time to add <a href=""/games/11"">Super Action Sports</a> to the games section as well. This was the <a href=""http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~boggus.2/5912/GameGroups.html"">capstone project</a> I completed near the end of my time at OSU last fall. It was my first 3D game project, and it was a lot of work! You can check that out in the games section now too.

In any case, thanks for stopping by! I hope some of you get a kick out of this update, now that there are more games to play. Stay tuned for more updates in the future, as I will continue to work on more projects as time allows!"
Small Side Project!,"March 5th, 2014","Hello again my loyal subset of friends, family, and that one internet stranger. Today I have a small update that will mean nothing to the most of you. I have spent a lot of time sharpening my Java skills in the past few months, and I took it upon myself to code a sufficient randomizer for <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder"">Kingdom Builder</a>, as none of the other ones I found were up to my standards of randomization. In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.

If you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/queengames/kingdom-builder-marshlands"">Kickstarter Page</a> to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have removed the Java applet version of this randomizer from my website. The good news is, a fully up-to-date and fully functioning Android App version has been published to the Google Play store. You can find that <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tylorlilley.kbrandomizer2&hl=en"">here</a>."
It's Facebook Official!,"January 9th, 2011","I'm only about one thousand years late to the party but due to repeated confusions with impersantors making fake facebook profiles of myself, I thought it was best to just make a real one, in order to stop the impersonators - even if I don't use it much. So if you want updates on The Tylor Zone on facebook, follow me <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheTylorZone"">here</a>! <del>I'll add a facebook button to this site somewhere soon when I have the time, too.</del> I added a button up top; you can't miss it. Happy face-booking. I'm still figuring out how everything works, so if I don't reply to you that's why..."
The Change That's Coming,"January 24th, 2012","I told you guys I was changing the site layout and working on things, and you didn't believe me. You brushed me off, you were like ""Oh, Tylor always says he's going to work on the website, and then he never actually does what he says he's going to."" Well, not this year baby. New Year's Resolution Ahoy!

If you haven't noticed, this is only the skeleton; the bare layout for the website to come. None of the links work yet. There's just this one page. But this is what it will look like. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am. Check back soon for a more fully functioning website!

As for what will become of the old website when I'm finished with this... I don't know. Part of me just wants to delete it all, and another part squirms every time I think about deleting it. I don't really want to put a link back to the old JavaScript-less site anywhere though. Maybe I will leave the files there, and just not link to them directly? In case someone wants to read the old site and knows to go in the backdoor? A lot of links would probably be broken in the process. I don't know. We'll see I guess. Feel free to give me your feedback if you have any, however."
Site Maintanence & Games Update,"November 17th, 2013","Hello everyone! It's been awhile since I sat down and did some much needed maintenance on the website. If my records are correct, the last time was May 15th of 2012... Yikes! As you might expect, almost every page needed at least a little updating.

The games page is where it shows the most though, as I moved things around and designed a new overall presentation for the page. Feel free to check it out! I had been lazy lately and hadn't updated it with most of my recent ""releases"", so I went ahead and did that too. There might just be a game or two that slipped under your radar in the past year and a half or so!"
Happy New Year!,"January 5th, 2013","Hey everybody! I know there hasn't been any new content in a little while due to me having to focus a lot of my free time into my schoolwork during my first semester at college, but things are looking up! All that hard work payed off in that I now know a new programming language - C and C++! (And in the good grades I got too, I guess. But that's less exciting to me.)

I'm still just a novice, but so far learning it and playing around with what I can do with it has been a lot of fun for me. For example, this recent Christmas break, busy as it was with spending time with friends and family, gave me an opportunity to play around with it some more on my own, and I may or may not even have a little text adventure game in the works!

If I am able to finish it before this next semester again steals my attention then you will see it up here in a little while. If not... hopefully I'll find time to come back to it in the future. Anyway, I just wanted to let everybody know that I have still been working on things, and that I made it through my first semester at college just fine. Here's to a successful second!

Game Section Updated!,"November 6th, 2015","As you may know, I completed a game for <a href=""http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=26293"">Ludum Dare 33</a> a few months ago. Well, now you can download that game from my Games section on the left! <a href=""/games/7"">Check it out for yourself</a>. I also took this opportunity to do some general maintenance around the website, including changing several of the other pages to make sure they contained only the most up-to-date information about me and what I have created. Feel free to check them out as well if you are interested.

Thanks for stopping by!"
Ludum Dare 33 - A Harrowing Journey,"August 24th, 2015","Hey! I did something for once. Score!

I participated in <a href=""http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=26293"">Ludum Dare</a>, the competition where you have to make a game and all its assets from scratch in 48 hours, again this past weekend. It was Ludum Dare 33, and the theme was ""You are the Monster"". And I made a game for it! It's called <a href=""/games/7"">A Harrowing Journey</a>, and you can check it out at the contest page here.

The things I am the most proud of are the music and text boxes. This was my first time making music for a game from scratch, and I am very happy with how that turned out! You can hear the full songs here and here if you want (I made two, and you can only hear parts of them in the game). It was a blast making them, and I maybe spent longer on them than I should have for the 48 hour competition... hopefully it was worth it.

The text boxes were something that seemed so simple to do in a game that I had always kind of avoided just because I had never really done it before. But I sucked it up and I did it this time and I'm glad I did because I think it worked out well! The game itself is not the best in terms of the game play, but it does all right for what it is. Thematically it may be a little similar to the game I did last time, 10 Seconds in Hell, which you can find on my games page following the link on the left. But for 48 hours I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Hopefully you enjoy it too, and if you end up checking it out, definitely let me know what you think of it!

Until next time!"
New Website!,"October 21st, 2019","Welcome to the new version of my website! I hope you like the new look. While the last version had been updated here and there over the past few years, the last major overhaul was performed when I was in my senior year of high school. For those counting, that was seven (!) years ago. As such, a new coat of paint (that was more responsive and looked nicer on devices of all sizes) was desperately needed.

Enter Ruby on Rails! I recently started a new job as a web developer for a company where their main language is Ruby on Rails. I've done a little bit with Ruby before, but never anything with rails. In fact, beyond a few years of vaguely related Salesforce development experience, I've never really developed web apps before at all. My history with programming definately lies much more in desktop applications, specifically games, and each page of my older websites have been pretty much purely handwritten HTML/CSS. Well, that's not the case anymore!

Since I was already learning Ruby on Rails for my new job, I decided it could be good practice to try rebuilding my website as a web app (and it was long overdue anyway). The new site should be easier to update as a result, which <i>could</i> mean more frequent updates in the future. But no promises! If you find any bugs with the new version of the site, please reach out and let me know. I hope you guys like the new style, and I'll see you next update - whenever that may be."
