Homestar the Runner,"Home! Star! Run! Go! Homestar Runner really great. Homestar Runner Athe-a-late. Homestar Runner; mom and dad. Look out Homestar! It's Strong Bad!

Homestar the Runner is a little minigame I created in 2008. It is styled after the retro-themed DVD menu for Homestar Runner's Everything Else Volume 3 DVD. The characters are not mine, but I did all of the graphics myself. It's just a simple little game I created as a longtime fan of their work. It's just Homestar doing what he does best: running. And, I guess, jumping, if you want to get technical. But that doesn't matter. What does matter is getting a high score than your friends! Check it out! No seriously, check it out.","July 15th, 2010",Look out Homestar! It's Strong Bad!,hr
Mage Battle,"Ah yes, my eternal nemesis, Galrond the Scarlet. At last we meet again on this floating field of battle. We have toiled against each other for many years, each always outdoing the other with ever more grand displays of arcane power and sorcery. But it is time to put this thirty-year feud to an end. It is time... for Mage Battle!

Mage Battle is a re-imagining of one of my earliest games. In this game you can battle against a variety of different types of computer-controlled AI mages, or kick it up a notch by challenging a friend! So far this one of my only two-player games to date. As a mage, you are trying to fire a shot to destroy your opponent while they are weak. But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.

The graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem. This is not the usual case with my games, but it used to be, and this game is a holdover from that young and innocent era of game design. This game means no infringement on any of the borrowed assets owner's rights, and is all in good fun.","March 15th, 2012","A fast-paced, two-player duel.",mage_battle
Grass Cutter,"Ah, feel that summer breeze. The smell of fresh grass clippings fill the air as you wipe the sweat from your forehead and pause to look up at the bright blue sky. Or at least it used to be bright blue - it looks like a storm's brewing. Better finish cutting the lawn fast, or you might be too drenched to get a sip of grandma's fresh squeezed lemonade!

Grass Cutter is a simple game about cutting grass. Or it would be simple, if those darn rain clouds would stop causing the grass to keep growing! This is based off of an old Atari game of the same name. I simply re-created it for use on our modern day computer technology... okay, and I added in a few... twists as well. I won't spoil anything for you, so you can find out for yourself. So what are you waiting for? Let's cut some grass!","June 1st, 2012",Let's cut some grass!,grass
Mighty Dive Bomber (Classic),"Oh no! Dr. Mischivio is at it again! Attacking from his castle in the center of evil Mischivio Island, he has kidnapped Princess Amalia and plans to take over the world! Our one hope is a hero who emerges from the ensuing chaos... Mighty Dive Bomber is here! He arrives with a bang, creating crash landings wherever he falls. Only he can outwit Dr. Mischivio's clever traps and solve the puzzles of Mischivio Isle before it is too late!

Mighty Dive Bomber is a retro, NES-styled puzzle platformer. It is a loveable parody of one my favorite ages in gaming, complete quirky story, and beepy sound effects from the days of yore. The graphics in this one are mostly done by me, with some parts edited from existing NES sprites. The game itself is loads of fun, and can actually be rather addictive. Like all good puzzle-platformers the concept is simple. All the usual bits are there: ladders, switches, keys, you name it. The innovation in this one is with Mighty Dive Bomber's only super-power: whenever you fall from a considerable height, you blow up the ground you land on! A great little game with over 30 levels and quite a bit of challenge later on. After completing Mighty Dive Bomber was the first time I sat back and really felt like I had made a video game. Because of that, it will always hold a special place in my heart.","July 30th, 2011",A retro-styled puzzle platformer!,mdb
Castle Climber,"Tell me, adventurer. Do you like magical potions with varying results? Ancient wands that cast strange and exciting spells? Powerful foes that must be dispatched with yet more powerful weaponry? Then Castle Climber is the game for you. Embark on a quest up every floor of the evil wizard's tower and wonder at the vexing oddities you find there in. And every time you die... a new tower forms, and a new quest is just beginning.

Castle Climber is a game that came about as the result of a single burning question: ""What would happen if I crossed The Legend of Zelda with Wario Ware?"" The answer was an interesting blend of action adventure and fast placed, short lived gameplay. Each floor of the castle is just a small, screen-sized room with various monsters, traps, and, yes, treasures, that would fit right at home in any NES action-adventure epic. It is a fast-paced, action-packed adventure that's different every time. Still not interested yet? I strongly recommend you give it a try and find out for yourself.""","June 15th, 2013",Randomly generated dungeon delving!,climber
10 Seconds in Hell,"Humans are flawed creatures. We each have our trials and temptations, but we have the power to choose between giving in or standing strong. Can you, a noble man, survive a descent into hell and all the deadly sins and evil souls that await you there? Will you be able to rescue the heart of your beloved and make it out with your soul intact? Or will you accidentally press the arrow key one too many times and step into a pool of lava?

Inspired chiefly by the old-school Atari game Adventure, 10 seconds in Hell was originally developed for Ludum Dare 27, a tri-annual 48 hour game making competition. After the original version scored 18th out of 2213 games in the Mood category, I continued to work on it and developed it into the full game you can play today. The game has pseudo-random generation elements so it is different each time you play. Have fun! Just be prepared to die a lot.","August 26th, 2013","A brutal, old-school adventure... in Hell.",hell
A Harrowing Journey,"A young man awakens in a field. Scattered about him are the remnants of a lost civilization. Although he doesn't want to admit it, the blood and debris seem strangely familiar to him. With an empty stomach and a guilty conscience, he sets off on a journey... a very harrowing journey.

This game was originally made for Ludum Dare 33, where the theme was ""You Are the Monster."" It's a short game, but it marks the first time I've tried my hand and creating music from scratch for one of my games! More than anything else I am proud of how the chiptune music for day and night turned out, especially given that they were only created in 48 hours for the game jam. Give it a shot if you feel like confronting your inner demons! Or just eating people I guess!","August 24th, 2015",It's time to find out who the real monster is.,journey
Might Dive Bomber,"Way back in 2011, I made what I considered to be my first ""real"" video game. It was a puzzle platformer called Mighty Dive Bomber (you can find this version of the game down below).Well, not too long after making it, I decided I could do it better. That version got very close to completion, but never saw the light of day. I picked it up again almost five years later, and finally finished it. This is that game.

This is by far the game I am most proud of having created. I feel like it represents the baseline for the level of polish in terms of presentation and gameplay experience I am able to create as a one-man team. Still, I feel like I could go even further if I wasn't just completing a project that I started five years ago, and instead was programming a game entirely from scratch. Will we see another Might Dive Bomber re-imagining in my lifetime? I would guess the answer is yes.

But in the mean time, this is a lovely verison of the game for you to enjoy. I hope you find it as engaging to play as I did to design and develop! This version of the game shares about 50% of its levels with the original, but the rest are all new (and contain some brand new game mechanics as well). Even if you already played the original, there should be a lot more here for you than just a shiny new coat of paint!","June 20th, 2018",Puzzle-platforming at its finest.,mdb3
Dragon's Lair,"If dragons love one thing, it's shiny, shiny gold. And what's this? The local peasants are so downtrodden they are willing to risk entering your lair just to swipe some of your precious, shiny gold? Not if you can help it! Burninate those peasants, and drive the invaders out of your lair!

Dragon's Lair began life as an experiment. I wanted to create a defend-your-castle style game with a twist - in between defending your castle, you would become the one attacking someone else's! Levels would alternate between the defend-your-castle style gameplay and a scrolling shooter style gameplay where you advanced and destroyed an enemy fortification. I chose to theme this idea as a dragon, since they are often seen both defending their lair from invaders and pillaging towns and stealing their precious treasure. Upgrades you earned in one mode would affect how your dragon controlled in both modes, and eventually there would be some kind of final level or something and probably an endless mode too.

Unfortunately only half of the game got created. This is a perfectly viable defend-your-castle game... but that's all it is. There's nothing incredibly innovative or exciting about it, since I never got around to implementing the scrolling shooter portions before moving on to a different project. But as this is still a perfectly playable game that a lot of work went into, I decided to host it here in case anyone wanted to play.","September 30th, 2012",Defend your gold by burninate-ing peasants!,dragon
Light Bringer,"here is a time that no one speaks of. A time when darkness encroached on the world, and all that was good and light shrunk back from its scratching claws until only a few cloistered hovels of civilization were left. These were the dark ages.

During these times, the people held on to but one hope: that one day a Lightbringer would be successful in his mission to drive back the darkness, and the world would fill with light and happiness again. Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.

This is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items. If you like what you see, don't forget to let me know - I could always resume work on the full game some day!","June 15th, 2012",Will YOU shine bright enough to overcome the darkness?,lightbringer
