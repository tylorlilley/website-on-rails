    As a huge fan of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy, I procrastinated on this game far too long. I originally played it a couple years ago in June 2020, and it really blew me away when I did. It got me hooked into the story and characters almost immediately, and when the whole thing was finished I could not believe the places the story ended up going while managing to make it all look obvious in hindsight. Very tightly written!

    I would highly recommend this game if you like visual novels with a light and unique puzzle element to them.
