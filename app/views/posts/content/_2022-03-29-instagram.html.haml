  I finished Lock n' Chase with no continues on my Beach Boy! This was a fun little game to try to get good at. Similar to Pac-Man but with a handful of unique stages and mechanics to work through. I quite enjoyed it!

    I completed the Extra Mode that unlocks upon completion as well, but I still had to use a continue on the very final level for that mode. I'll keep at it and I bet I'll be able to get it done without any Game Overs too!
