  Krazy Racers for GBA. Completed all cups on the hardest difficulty, unlocked all hidden characters, got 1st in all the time trials, and achieved S Rank.

    This was a fun little Mario Kart clone! It was very weird to see Konami characters like Grey Fox and Dracula in a cutesy setting like this. I never would have given this a chance if it wasn't a part of the Game Boy Game of the Month contest, but it was actually a lot of fun! It's making me wonder if I should go back and give Mario Kart: Super Circuit another shot, since I remember not loving that game as a kid. Maybe that's what I'll play next!
