%p Make sure you have the latest version. If you downloaded it on Sunday or before 7:00 on Saturday, you may have a version that has more glitches and less polish on it. To check, you can scroll down to the bottom of the text that pops up at the very beginning of the game. In the small text at the bottom it should say that you are playing version 1.6. If not, re-download it to play the latest, hopeful final, glitch free version. Happy Playing!
