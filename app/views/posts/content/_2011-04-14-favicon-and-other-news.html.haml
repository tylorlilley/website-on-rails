%p First thing's first -if you know me, then you know that I just recently had a battle of wits with my computing device. The thing was so near death from overheating problems and virus problems, after a recent onslought of failures, that I almost gave up on it and began the hunt for a new laptop. But give up I did not, and after a draining week of spending all my free time attacking this thing I finally (fingers-crossed) got it back on its feet. However, I did have to wipe it of everything and return it to factoy settings. Its a good thing I backed up my files beforehand! Hey, you. Yes, you, the reader. Have you backed up your files recently? If not, I would take the time to do so now. You'll thank me later.

    In other news, I was recently a part of my high school's amazing production of Godspell, in which I was honored have a part in the chorus. I
    %i loved
    this musical, and I loved everybody who participated in it. If you didn't get to see it, you really missed out on some quality entertainment. I feel bad for you. But, hey, you can at least console yourself with the fact that I am going to create a YouTube channel and upload some of the better recorded songs from our little musical that Isaac Steinhour (better known to us as Jesus) put together for us. I don't think I'd be patting myself on the back too much, considereing I am only a memeber of the chorus and cannot even be distinguished from the other voices on the CD, to say that we sound GOOD. If you don't believe me, you can hear them for yourself

    along with a few more songs to come as I find the time to upload them over the next few days. If it all checks out with the superiors, I might even be able to put up a taped version of the musical on the channel, so that all of you who missed out on seeing it live can at least get a taste of what it was like. Unfortunately, it will be nothing like seeing in person, but that ship has already sailed so to speak.
  %p So, yeah, that's where I was and what I was doing the past few months that this site sat more or less untouched. The only other tidbit of information I have to share with you is the wonderful new bookmark image I created for the site, since it looked plain and boring without one. You should be able to view it now, up on the top of your browser, next to the words "The Tylor Zone - Home" on the top of this page's tab.
  %p Now that my schedule is somewhat more clear, and summer is fast approaching, I plan on updating this site more often than I had the last few months when I was completely swamped. So stay on the lookout for new stuff! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have to go crash after four intesive days of computer hardware/virus battling. Buenas noches, mis amigos.
