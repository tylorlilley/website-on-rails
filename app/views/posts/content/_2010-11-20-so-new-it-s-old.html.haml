  Well what do we have here? The grand re-opening of TylorLilley.com -
  %i The Tylor Zone 2010 2.0.
  Isn't it great? What's that you say? It looks almost exactly the same? Well, on the outside, sure, but on the inside.... man! What a difference! ...Yeah, so, okay, I know you don't care.

Honestly the biggest difference is just the fact that the entire things has been remade in html code, so the fact that it looks similar on the outside actually verifies that I succeded in what I set out to do. What this means for you however, is that I'l lwill probably update more, since updating will be much faster now that I completely understand how every nook and cranny of my site's code works - y'know, what with me being the one he typed each character of it and all. But for now, not much has changed. This is one of those do-a-lot-of-work-in-the-short-run, save-yourself-from-a-lot-of-work-in-the-long-run type deals. Oh well. Enjoy!
