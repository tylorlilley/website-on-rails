  It's just about the 20th anniversary of the release of Mario Pinball Land for the GBA. Everyone's favorite and most fondly remembered pinball adventure game set within the Mario universe.

    I recently got a personal high score of over 50 million (with no save states/funny business). For contxet the number one slot on the high score board comes preloaded as a score of 10 million. So it's a lot higher than that; a pretty inhuman number. It took about 6 hours of (non-continuous) playtime without getting a single game over and while collecting 100% of the possible collectibles in one go. I probably could have gotten to a maxed out score counter (at 99 million and some change) by continuing to just grind out points 100 at a time on bumpers and things before completing the game's final boss but I was satisfied without putting in the many more hours of time necessary to do that ð  %p
