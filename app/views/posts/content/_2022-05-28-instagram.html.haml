  I got every treasure in Wario Land 3! This was a game I'd completed before, but it was still really fun to revisit. Its not quite as near to my heart as Wario Land 4 is, but I remember it being one of the few Gameboy Color games I owned growing up (mostly what I had were Gameboy Advance games). And its still a really fun experience!
