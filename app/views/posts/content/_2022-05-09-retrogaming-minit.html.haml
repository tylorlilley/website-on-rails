  I finished Minit for the Nintendo Switch! This was a super cool little indie game where you die every sixty seconds. I enjoyed it enough that I ended up beating both the normal mode and the much harder Second Run with 100% completion. I had to look up the locations of the last couple coins to get that sweet 110% though - some of those were pretty deviously hidden!

    This was a creative game that very much reminded me of the kinds of games I would make myself in Game Maker - with a decent amount of additional polish, of course. I highly recommend it if you have a few hours (and dollars) to kill.
