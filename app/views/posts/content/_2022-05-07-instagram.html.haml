  As a happy new owner of a PlayStation 5, I 100% completed Astro's Playroom! For a free pack in gane this was a pretty fun little adventure. Obviously leaning heavily on PlayStation nostalgia, but what can I say - it worked on me. Some of the references were pretty deep cuts! Now to play some meatier games on this thing.
