%p What's all this then? Forums? On MY website? Yes folks, it's true. Finally, a feature brand spanking new to those of you who have ever been to my older websites - the Forums. Go there, sign up, and talk about crap! I honestly don't expect it to be very active, but hey - if even just a few of my friends use it it might attract more attention, so at the least, please register and make your self an account in case you get really really bored sometime in the near future and wanna mess around on them. You won't regret it!
