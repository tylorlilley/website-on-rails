  I finished getting all of the endings in Deadeus. There was nothing that blew me away about this little experience gameplay-wise, but it was definitely neat to play a "new" Game Boy game from 2019! And it was the perfect game for testing out the blood red Neon Pinball Matrix display setting on my Analogue Pocket. Although, with a handheld from 2021 and a game from 2019 I don't even think I can describe this as retro gaming anymore!
