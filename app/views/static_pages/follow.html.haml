      On this page are some links to my other accounts on webpages across the
      internet. These are just the accounts I'm currently active at; there are
      many sites I used to frequent that I haven't gone to in years. Those
      accounts may still be open, but they aren't listed here anymore. But feel
      free to check me out at these other places on the web!

      And there you have it. A list of all the places on the web where I am
      currently active. Feel free to like my Facebook page if you want easy
      updates whenever I have a new game or something to show off! I don't
      update much, but that way when I do you will be notified... if you want to
      be notified about that sort of thing in the first place, that is.
