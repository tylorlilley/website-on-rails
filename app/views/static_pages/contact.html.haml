      If you have a question for me, feedback on some of my previous work, or
      any other reason to contact me, feel free to do so at this address:
      %a{:href => "mailto:tylor@tylorlilley.com"} tylor@tylorlilley.com
      \. I am not very active on social media, so good old fashioned email is definitely
      the best way you can reach me with any concerns. That said, I do my
      best to respond to all emails I receive, so don't hesitate to reach out!
