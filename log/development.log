A time when darkness encroached on the world, and all that was good and light shrunk back from its scratching claws until only a few cloistered hovels of civilization were left. These were the dark ages.\n\nDuring these times, the people held on to but one hope: that one day a Lightbringer would be successful in his mission to drive back the darkness, and the world would fill with light and happiness again. Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items. If you like what you see, don't forget to let me know - I could always resume work on the full game some day!"], ["date", "2012-06-15"], ["tagline", "Will you shine bright enough to overcome the darkness?"], ["filename", "lightbringer"], ["created_at", "2019-10-18 14:13:15.526238"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-18 14:13:15.526238"]]

Burninate those peasants, and drive the invaders out of your lair!\n\nDragon's Lair began life as an experiment. I wanted to create a defend-your-castle style game with a twist - in between defending your castle, you would become the one attacking someone else's! Levels would alternate between the defend-your-castle style gameplay and a scrolling shooter style gameplay where you advanced and destroyed an enemy fortification. I chose to theme this idea as a dragon, since they are often seen both defending their lair from invaders and pillaging towns and stealing their precious treasure. Upgrades you earned in one mode would affect how your dragon controlled in both modes, and eventually there would be some kind of final level or something and probably an endless mode too.\n\nUnfortunately only half of the game got created. This is a perfectly viable defend-your-castle game... but that's all it is. There's nothing incredibly innovative or exciting about it, since I never got around to implementing the scrolling shooter portions before moving on to a different project. But as this is still a perfectly playable game that a lot of work went into, I decided to host it here in case anyone wanted to play."], ["date", "2012-09-15"], ["tagline", "Defend your gold by burninate-ing peasants!"], ["filename", "dragon"], ["created_at", "2019-10-18 20:15:41.550551"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-18 20:15:41.550551"]]

I recently started a new job as a web developer for a company where their main language is Ruby on Rails. I've done a little bit with Ruby before, but never anything with rails. In fact, beyond a few years of vaguely related Salesforce development experience, I've never really developed web apps before at all. My history with programming definately lies much more in desktop applications, specifically games, and each page of my older websites have been pretty much purely handwritten HTML/CSS. Well, that's not the case anymore!\nSince I was already learning Ruby on Rails for my new job, I decided it could be good practice to try rebuilding my website as a web app (and it was long overdue anyway). The new site should be easier to update as a result, which <i>could</i> mean more frequent updates in the future. But no promises!

In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) Kickstarter Page to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use!

For example, this recent Christmas break, busy as it was with spending time with friends and family, gave me an opportunity to play around with it some more on my own, and I may or may not even have a little text adventure game in the works!\n\nIf I am able to finish it before this next semester again steals my attention then you will see it up here in a little while.

But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem.

It was a puzzle platformer called Mighty Dive Bomber (you can find this version of the game down below).Well, not too long after making it, I decided I could do it better. That version got very close to completion, but never saw the light of day. I picked it up again almost five years later, and finally finished it. This is that game.\n\nThis is by far the game I am most proud of having created. I feel like it represents the baseline for the level of polish in terms of presentation and gameplay experience I am able to create as a one-man team. Still, I feel like I could go even further if I wasn't just completing a project that I started five years ago, and instead was programming a game entirely from scratch. Will we see another Might Dive Bomber re-imagining in my lifetime? I would guess the answer is yes.\n\nBut in the mean time, this is a lovely verison of the game for you to enjoy. I hope you find it as engaging to play as I did to design and develop! This version of the game shares about 50% of its levels with the original, but the rest are all new (and contain some brand new game mechanics as well).

And what's this? The local peasants are so downtrodden they are willing to risk entering your lair just to swipe some of your precious, shiny gold? Not if you can help it! Burninate those peasants, and drive the invaders out of your lair!\n\nDragon's Lair began life as an experiment. I wanted to create a defend-your-castle style game with a twist - in between defending your castle, you would become the one attacking someone else's! Levels would alternate between the defend-your-castle style gameplay and a scrolling shooter style gameplay where you advanced and destroyed an enemy fortification. I chose to theme this idea as a dragon, since they are often seen both defending their lair from invaders and pillaging towns and stealing their precious treasure. Upgrades you earned in one mode would affect how your dragon controlled in both modes, and eventually there would be some kind of final level or something and probably an endless mode too.\n\nUnfortunately only half of the game got created. This is a perfectly viable defend-your-castle game... but that's all it is. There's nothing incredibly innovative or exciting about it, since I never got around to implementing the scrolling shooter portions before moving on to a different project.

Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer.

Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now.

I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) Kickstarter Page to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises."], ["date", "2014-03-05"], ["created_at", "2019-10-22 14:12:15.118795"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 14:12:15.118795"]]

But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem.

A time when darkness encroached on the world, and all that was good and light shrunk back from its scratching claws until only a few cloistered hovels of civilization were left. These were the dark ages.\n\nDuring these times, the people held on to but one hope: that one day a Lightbringer would be successful in his mission to drive back the darkness, and the world would fill with light and happiness again. Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items. If you like what you see, don't forget to let me know - I could always resume work on the full game some day!"], ["date", "2012-06-15"], ["tagline", "Will YOU shine bright enough to overcome the darkness?"], ["filename", "lightbringer"], ["created_at", "2019-10-22 14:17:15.078360"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 14:17:15.078360"]]

In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) Kickstarter Page to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use!

A time when darkness encroached on the world, and all that was good and light shrunk back from its scratching claws until only a few cloistered hovels of civilization were left. These were the dark ages.\n\nDuring these times, the people held on to but one hope: that one day a Lightbringer would be successful in his mission to drive back the darkness, and the world would fill with light and happiness again. Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items. If you like what you see, don't forget to let me know - I could always resume work on the full game some day!"], ["date", "2012-06-15"], ["tagline", "Will YOU shine bright enough to overcome the darkness?"], ["filename", "lightbringer"], ["created_at", "2019-10-22 14:33:15.412731"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 14:33:15.412731"]]

Today I have a small update that will mean nothing to the most of you. I have spent a lot of time sharpening my Java skills in the past few months, and I took it upon myself to code a sufficient randomizer for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder\">Kingdom Builder</a>, as none of the other ones I found were up to my standards of randomization. In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/queengames/kingdom-builder-marshlands\">Kickstarter Page</a> to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises.\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have removed the Java applet version of this randomizer from my website. The good news is, a fully up-to-date and fully functioning Android App version has been published to the Google Play store.

You can hear the full songs here and here if you want (I made two, and you can only hear parts of them in the game). It was a blast making them, and I maybe spent longer on them than I should have for the 48 hour competition... hopefully it was worth it.\n\nThe text boxes were something that seemed so simple to do in a game that I had always kind of avoided just because I had never really done it before. But I sucked it up and I did it this time and I'm glad I did because I think it worked out well! The game itself is not the best in terms of the game play, but it does all right for what it is. Thematically it may be a little similar to the game I did last time, 10 Seconds in Hell, which you can find on my games page following the link on the left.

At last we meet again on this floating field of battle. We have toiled against each other for many years, each always outdoing the other with ever more grand displays of arcane power and sorcery. But it is time to put this thirty-year feud to an end. It is time... for <strong>Mage Battle</strong>!\n\nMage Battle is a re-imagining of one of my earliest games. In this game you can battle against a variety of different types of computer-controlled AI mages, or kick it up a notch by challenging a friend! So far this one of my only two-player games to date. As a mage, you are trying to fire a shot to destroy your opponent while they are weak. But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem. This is not the usual case with my games, but it used to be, and this game is a holdover from that young and innocent era of game design.

It was a puzzle platformer called <%= link_to 'Mighty Dive Bomber', Game.find_by(name: M'ighty Dive Bomber (Classic)') %>.Well, not too long after making it, I decided I could do it better. That version got very close to completion, but never saw the light of day. I picked it up again almost five years later, and finally finished it. This is that game.\n\nThis is by far the game I am most proud of having created. I feel like it represents the baseline for the level of polish in terms of presentation and gameplay experience I am able to create as a one-man team. Still, I feel like I could go even further if I wasn't just completing a project that I started five years ago, and instead was programming a game entirely from scratch. Will we see another Might Dive Bomber re-imagining in my lifetime? I would guess the answer is yes.\n\nBut in the mean time, this is a lovely verison of the game for you to enjoy. I hope you find it as engaging to play as I did to design and develop! This version of the game shares about 50% of its levels with the original, but the rest are all new (and contain some brand new game mechanics as well). Even if you already played the original, there should be a lot more here for you than just a shiny new coat of paint!"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 16:04:28.361568"], ["id", 8]]

It was a puzzle platformer called <a href=\"/games/4\">Mighty Dive Bomber</a>.Well, not too long after making it, I decided I could do it better. That version got very close to completion, but never saw the light of day. I picked it up again almost five years later, and finally finished it. This is that game.\n\nThis is by far the game I am most proud of having created. I feel like it represents the baseline for the level of polish in terms of presentation and gameplay experience I am able to create as a one-man team. Still, I feel like I could go even further if I wasn't just completing a project that I started five years ago, and instead was programming a game entirely from scratch. Will we see another Might Dive Bomber re-imagining in my lifetime? I would guess the answer is yes.\n\nBut in the mean time, this is a lovely verison of the game for you to enjoy. I hope you find it as engaging to play as I did to design and develop! This version of the game shares about 50% of its levels with the original, but the rest are all new (and contain some brand new game mechanics as well). Even if you already played the original, there should be a lot more here for you than just a shiny new coat of paint!"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 16:13:16.250443"], ["id", 8]]

Today I have a small update that will mean nothing to the most of you. I have spent a lot of time sharpening my Java skills in the past few months, and I took it upon myself to code a sufficient randomizer for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder\">Kingdom Builder</a>, as none of the other ones I found were up to my standards of randomization. In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/queengames/kingdom-builder-marshlands\">Kickstarter Page</a> to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises.\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have removed the Java applet version of this randomizer from my website. The good news is, a fully up-to-date and fully functioning Android App version has been published to the Google Play store.

But that's less exciting to me.)\n\nI'm still just a novice, but so far learning it and playing around with what I can do with it has been a lot of fun for me. For example, this recent Christmas break, busy as it was with spending time with friends and family, gave me an opportunity to play around with it some more on my own, and I may or may not even have a little text adventure game in the works!\n\nIf I am able to finish it before this next semester again steals my attention then you will see it up here in a little while. If not... hopefully I'll find time to come back to it in the future. Anyway, I just wanted to let everybody know that I have still been working on things, and that I made it through my first semester at college just fine. Here's to a successful second!\n\n"], ["date", "2013-01-05"], ["created_at", "2019-10-22 16:28:38.582054"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 16:28:38.582054"]]

With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases.

A time when darkness encroached on the world, and all that was good and light shrunk back from its scratching claws until only a few cloistered hovels of civilization were left.

Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items.

While we initailly had larger plans for adding yet more games and features to this collection after finishing it, we ultimately decided to go our separate ways. Thus, <i>Super Action Sports!</i> is considered complete in this form, a testament to all the blood, sweat, and tears that we put into it as a team during development.\n\nGive it a quick spin if you've got a buddy or two and want to kill some time playing silly games!

Today I have a small update that will mean nothing to the most of you. I have spent a lot of time sharpening my Java skills in the past few months, and I took it upon myself to code a sufficient randomizer for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder\">Kingdom Builder</a>, as none of the other ones I found were up to my standards of randomization. In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/queengames/kingdom-builder-marshlands\">Kickstarter Page</a> to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises.\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have removed the Java applet version of this randomizer from my website. The good news is, a fully up-to-date and fully functioning Android App version has been published to the Google Play store.

You can hear the full songs here and here if you want (I made two, and you can only hear parts of them in the game). It was a blast making them, and I maybe spent longer on them than I should have for the 48 hour competition... hopefully it was worth it.\n\nThe text boxes were something that seemed so simple to do in a game that I had always kind of avoided just because I had never really done it before. But I sucked it up and I did it this time and I'm glad I did because I think it worked out well! The game itself is not the best in terms of the game play, but it does all right for what it is. Thematically it may be a little similar to the game I did last time, 10 Seconds in Hell, which you can find on my games page following the link on the left.

I hope you like the new look. While the last version had been updated here and there over the past few years, the last major overhaul was performed when I was in my senior year of high school. For those counting, that was seven (!) years ago. As such, a new coat of paint (that was more responsive and looked nicer on devices of all sizes) was desperately needed.\n\nEnter Ruby on Rails! I recently started a new job as a web developer for a company where their main language is Ruby on Rails. I've done a little bit with Ruby before, but never anything with rails. In fact, beyond a few years of vaguely related Salesforce development experience, I've never really developed web apps before at all. My history with programming definately lies much more in desktop applications, specifically games, and each page of my older websites have been pretty much purely handwritten HTML/CSS. Well, that's not the case anymore!\n\nSince I was already learning Ruby on Rails for my new job, I decided it could be good practice to try rebuilding my website as a web app (and it was long overdue anyway).

In this game you can battle against a variety of different types of computer-controlled AI mages, or kick it up a notch by challenging a friend! So far this one of my only two-player games to date. As a mage, you are trying to fire a shot to destroy your opponent while they are weak. But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem.

Today I have a small update that will mean nothing to the most of you. I have spent a lot of time sharpening my Java skills in the past few months, and I took it upon myself to code a sufficient randomizer for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/107529/kingdom-builder\">Kingdom Builder</a>, as none of the other ones I found were up to my standards of randomization. In doing so I learned a lot about Java swing applications and embedding applets in an html page. It was quite fun, really! I mean, aside from all the hours of frustration and head banging that always accompanies working with code when you don't know what you're doing and are trying to teach yourself.\n\nIf you've never heard of Kingdom Builder before, then you can check out its currently ongoing (until March 8th) <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/queengames/kingdom-builder-marshlands\">Kickstarter Page</a> to find out more about the game. I will do my best to keep this thing updated as new releases/expansions come out, and I'm proud to say that it is equipped with quite a few ranomization options to use! If you're interested, you can play around with it over here. Thanks as always for checking in! Maybe the next one will be more relevant to you people... but I make no promises.\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have removed the Java applet version of this randomizer from my website. The good news is, a fully up-to-date and fully functioning Android App version has been published to the Google Play store.

But before you can fire any shots, you must first store up energy charges - leaving yourself open to be obliterated while you do so. You can also deflect on-coming magic blasts with ease by shielding - but shielding will not charge your magic. With these powers at your disposal, it's a race to see whether you can kill your opponent first - or whether they will kill you.\n\nThe graphics and sound effects in this game were not created by me, only edited in some cases. Most are taken from actual video games like Super Smash Brothers Melee and Fire Emblem.

Burninate those peasants, and drive the invaders out of your lair!\n\nDragon's Lair began life as an experiment. I wanted to create a defend-your-castle style game with a twist - in between defending <i>your</i> castle, you would become the one attacking someone else's! Levels would alternate between the defend-your-castle style gameplay and a scrolling shooter style gameplay where you advanced and destroyed an enemy fortification. I chose to theme this idea as a dragon, since they are often seen both defending their lair from invaders and pillaging towns and stealing their precious treasure. Upgrades you earned in one mode would affect how your dragon controlled in <i>both</i> modes, and eventually there would be some kind of final level or something and probably an endless mode too.\n\nUnfortunately only half of the game got created. This is a perfectly viable defend-your-castle game... but that's all it is. There's nothing incredibly innovative or exciting about it, since I never got around to implementing the scrolling shooter portions before moving on to a different project. But as this is still a perfectly playable game that a lot of work went into, I decided to host it here in case anyone wanted to play."], ["date", "2012-09-30"], ["tagline", "Defend your gold by burninate-ing peasants!"], ["filename", "dragon"], ["created_at", "2019-10-22 18:59:09.757366"], ["updated_at", "2019-10-22 18:59:09.757366"], ["image_width", 600], ["image_height", 480]]

Being chosen to be a Lightbringer was the highest honor... but it was also certainly a sign of your impending demise, as no Lightbringer had ever returned alive. But maybe, just maybe, you will be the one that does. All you have left is that one hope.\n\nThis is the demo of the game engine I developed for a metroidvania style exploration game named Lightbringer. This demo shows off the game mechanics under the guise of a single Lightbringer mission to a nearby cave, and stands alone apart from the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I never finished the main Lightbringer game, and this is all that remains of it now. It is still a fun bit of exploration that will maybe take you about an hour to complete, give or take - assuming you are able to find all the hidden items.
